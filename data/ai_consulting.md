- **Timeline:** 4–12 weeks depending on complexity
- **Deliverables:** Trained model, API endpoint, documentation, monitoring dashboard
- **Success Metric:** Models are validated against domain-specific benchmarks before delivery

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Our NLP solutions power intelligent text analysis, chatbots, document understanding, and content generation. We build custom solutions using state-of-the-art transformer models.

- **Capabilities:** Text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, document summarization, question-answering systems
- **Technologies:** Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, OpenAI GPT, LangChain
- **Timeline:** 3–8 weeks

### Computer Vision

We build computer vision systems for image classification, object detection, OCR, and video analytics. Applications include quality inspection, medical imaging, security surveillance, and document digitization.

- **Technologies:** OpenCV, YOLOv8, ResNet, Vision Transformers
- **Timeline:** 6–14 weeks

### AI Strategy & Consulting

Not sure where to start with AI? Our strategy consultants assess your business, identify high-impact AI opportunities, and create a practical roadmap. We conduct AI readiness assessments, data audits, and ROI projections.
